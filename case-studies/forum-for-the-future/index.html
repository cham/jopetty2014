                <a href="http://www.forumforthefuture.org/" target="_blank">Forum for the Future</a> is a not-for-profit which works with companies and organisations on sustainability issues. A global organisation, they were redesigning their website and required new copy to bring their website into a consistent tone of voice.

                <h2>The brief</h2>
                <p>
                    Forum for the Future required a copywriter to refresh its existing copy, make it more streamlined and give it a consistent tone of voice. The organisation already had very detailed style guides and there were a lot of guidelines I had to work to. I worked to a very detailed brief too, with well thought out deadlines and word counts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main thing that needed addressing was the use of jargon and technical language across the site. The original site was difficult to read, and didn’t get across the point of the website or the company efficiently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I created content for all sections of their new website and worked with key members of their staff to ensure the content was accurate and reflected Forum for the Future’s ethos. I also worked with the design and development team to ensure the copy I wrote would fit in well with the design of the new website.
                </p>
                <h3>The result</h3>

                </p>
                <p>
                    The final product left the organisation with fresh new copy which reflected the brand and also helped users understand what they do a lot easier, removing a lot of the jargon that previously was on the site.
                </p>
                <p>
