                I'm currently running the blog and Twitter account for Popupspace, a

                businesses, restaurants and PR companies.

                <h2>The brief</h2>
                <p>
                    Popupspace needed me to take managing their blog and Twitter feed off of their hands and create a consistent feed of content promoting their services and the industry as a whole. They needed some guidance on how to approach creating content, and also required me to upload posts to their blog which is powered by WordPress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I created a blog and social media strategy for the client, a document which took into account what their competitors are doing, how their analytics look, and also contained a plan of action which had ideas for future blog posts. This document became a vital reference point for both myself and the client to ensure the campaign is running on track.
                </p>
                <h3>The result</h3>

                    <img src="img/example2.jpg">

                <p>
                    Since the start of the year interactions on Twitter have gone up and there’s a steady flow of approximately 20 new followers each week.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The client had this to say about my work:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    Jo has been great to work with; she quickly picked up the brief we gave her and put forward creative ideas and suggestions. Results have been good and we are happy to recommend Jo’s services.
                </blockquote>
                <p>
