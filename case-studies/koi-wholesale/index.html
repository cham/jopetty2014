                Koi Wholesale: on-site copy for their new website
            </h1>
            <p class="lighttext">
                <a href="http://www.koi-wholesale.co.uk/" target="_blank">Koi Wholesale</a> specialises in selling Japanese koi carp wholesale to businesses across the UK. They approached me requiring new copy for their new website which was in the process of being redesigned.

                <h2>The brief</h2>
                <p>
                    Koi Wholesale had already thought about the content that they wanted to have on their new site and approached me with the layout of the new site plus some notes on the points that they wanted to communicate to their clients. This made it easy and clear for me to understand what copy I needed to provide them with. They wanted the copy to be easy to understand and simple, to match in with their new design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most people visiting the site would already have some familiarity with koi handling and the sale of it, so they wanted copy that would focus on their main selling points of providing healthy fish, maintaining genuine contacts with Japan, and having an extensive quarantine facility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A relatively quick job, there was only around 10 pages which made up the site, two or three of which were text heavy and needed to be well thought out. Their preparation with an easy to understand brief enabled me to quickly deliver content in an area I was unfamiliar with, which also enabled them to launch their site speedily.
                </p>
                <h3>The result</h3>

                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="http://www.koi-wholesale.co.uk/about" target="_blank"><img src="img/koi-about.png"></a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="http://www.koi-wholesale.co.uk/ways-to-buy" target="_blank"><img src="img/koi-buy.png"></a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final result left Koi Wholesale with clear, precise copy that communicates what they do effectively and promotes the company in a friendly manner.
